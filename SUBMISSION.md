**TODO:** Lyubov Chebotareva Student ID 2023534

**TODO:** Add your screen captures to a new directory called [images](images).

**HINT:** Embed your screen captures as requested in the sections below. You can embed the image using the following syntax:

```
Screenshot list
![Screen Capture Ant version and location directory #1](images/ant.png)
![Screen Capture of the output generated by Ant go-nodeps #2](images/go-nodeps1.png)
![Screen Capture of the successful build Ant+Ivy script #3](images/ant+ivy.png)
![Screen Capture of the JAR file from the Ant+Ivy build #4](images/hello_world_ant.png)
![Screen Capture Maven version and location directory #5](images/maven.png)
![Screen Capture of successful build Maven script #6](images/maven_building_path.png)
![Screen Capture of successful build Maven script #7](images/tests_maven1.png)
![Screen Capture of successful build Maven script #8](images/build_maven.png)
![Screen Capture of the JAR file from the Maven build](images/hello-world_maven.png)
![Screen Capture Gradle version and location directory #9](images/gradle.png)
![Screen Capture of the scuccessful build the Gardle script #10](images/build-gradle.png)
![Screen Capture of the JAR file from the Gradle build #11](images/hello-world-gradle.png)
```

The first argument is the Alt-text for the image. The second argument is the path to the image. Make sure your images are readable and that you save them in a JPG or PNG format.
